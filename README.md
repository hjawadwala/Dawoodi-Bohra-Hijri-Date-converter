This scripts converts Gregorian date to Dawoodi Bohra Hijri Date . This is based on the logic mentioned at [https://www.thedawoodibohras.com/the_dawoodi_bohra_calendar](https://www.thedawoodibohras.com/2017/11/30/the-misri-hijri-calendar/)

## An introduction to the Misri/Hijri calendar

The calculation for the Hijri calendar used by the Dawoodi Bohras is provided in the Sahifa (commonly known as the “Bu Saheba Sahifa”). A brief outline of these calculations is provided below:

Every year has 354 days and is divided into 12 months; six of them are “complete” (kamil) in the sense of being of 30 days each and the other six are “incomplete” (naqis); of 29 days each. The year starts with a complete month (Muharram followed by an incomplete month (Safar). All odd months are complete and all even are incomplete. Every so often, an extra day is added to the last month of the year (Zil Hijjah), to make up for the small difference each year of hours and minutes. Such years are known as kabisa years and they have a similar effect on the Hijri calendar as leap years in the Gregorian calendar.

The calculation to determine if a year is a kabisa year is a little complex. The system has two cycles, a big cycle (Qarn Kabir) and another small one (Qarn Saghir). A Qarn Kabir consists of 210 years while a Qarn Saghir consists of 30 years. The Qarn Saghir has 11 kabisa years which are those years that have a remainder of 2, 5, 8, 10, 13, 16, 19, 21, 24, 27 or 29, when divided by 30. For example, suppose we want to determine if the Hijri year 1431 is a kabisa year. Dividing 1431 by 30 gives 47, with a remainder of 21. That is:

1431 ÷ 30= 47 and remainder 21 (i.e. 21/30)

or (30 x 47) + 21 = 1431

The number 21 is one of the numbers in the list for Qarn Saghir, so 1431 is a kabisa year. However, the Hijri year 1432 gives a remainder of 22 when divided by 30. The number 22 is not in the list for Qarn Saghir, so 1432 is not a kabisa year.
(The kabisa year calculation example provided in the “Bu Saheba Sahifa” – a reference book for Dawoodi Bohra jurisprudential canons and other practices”)

To remember these years, dawat texts give them in verse. 
According to a Prophetic tradition prevalent in the Da’wah literature, a few interesting aspects of the calendar are:

1) every 8th year, the hijri calendar is repeated, i.e., the days and the dates of the 1st year are repeated in the 8th year,

(2) the 4th of Rajab, the 1st of Shahr-e-Ramadan and Eid al-Adha fall on the same day,

(3) the 5th of Rajab, Laylat al-Qadr (23rd night of the month of Ramadan) and Eid al-Ghadir will all fall on the same day,

(4) the 6th of Rajab, the New Year and Eid al-Fitr will all fall on the same day

The Hijri calendar followed by the Dawoodi Bohras is appreciated for its accuracy and has benefited the community in marking out auspicious dates and event planning. As we celebrate the Mawlid of Prophet Mohammed SAW, we are reminded that, regardless of a person’s belief in his prophecy or otherwise this was the birth of one of the greatest personalities of all time, a prophet who changed the course of history. That same day and date, Monday the 12th of Rabi al-Awwal, also marks the Hijrah from when is the “beginning of history” in the context of Islam.
